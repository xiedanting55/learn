                However odd it may seem, he never suspected the truth; it burst upon him suddenly. He realized that he
                was unable to remember the shapes, sounds, and colors of his dreams; there were no shapes, colors, or
                sounds, nor were the dreams dreams. They were his reality, a reality beyond silence and sight, and
                therefore beyond memory. This realization threw him into even greater consternation than the fact that
                from the hour of his death he had been struggling in a whirlwind of senseless images. The voices he'd
                heard had been echoes; the faces he'd seen had been masks; the fingers of his hands had been
                shadows—vague and insubstantial, true, yet also dear to him, and familiar.

        <p class="text">The death throes done, he lay now alone—alone and broken and rejected— and then he sank into

    <div class="page page2">
        <p class="text">When he awoke, there awaited him his commonplace habits and the places of his everyday
            existence. He told himself that he shouldn't think too much about the night before, and, cheered
            by that resolve, he unhurriedly dressed for work. At the office, he got through his duties passably
            well, though with that uneasy sense (caused by weariness) of repeating things he'd already done.
            He seemed to notice that the others turned their eyes away; perhaps they already knew that he
            was dead.</p>

    <div class="page page2">
        <p class="text">That night the nightmares began; he was left without the slightest memory of them—just the fear
            that they'd return. In time, that fear prevailed; it came between him and the page he was
            supposed to write, the books he tried to read. Letters would crawl about on the page like ants;
            faces, familiar faces, gradually blurred and faded, objects and people slowly abandoned him. His
            mind seized upon those changing shapes in a frenzy of tenacity.</p>
